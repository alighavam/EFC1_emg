# EFC1_emg
Recording simultaneous EMG from human finger flexors/extensors. Muscles include dorsal and ventral forearm muscles as well as palmar flexors. 

EMGs from the same muscles are recorded in two sessions. During the first session, subjects execute finger configurations involving simultaneous flexions and extensions. In the second session, subjects are instructed to do a set of natural hand movements.
